msgid "<strong>Persistent</strong> is a convenience feature helpful when you are manually entering a series of records in the admin. If set, it means the field will carry over to the next blank entry. For instance, if a group of records from the same city are being entered, set the \"city\" field to be persistent, then once a city value has been entered in the first record of the series, the next blank record will have this city pre-filled."
msgstr "<strong>Persistente</strong> Utile quando inserisci una serie di record come admin. Se spuntato, riporta il dato nella iscrizione successiva. Esempio, se inserisci un gruppo di records dello stesso Comune, se marcato persistente, nel record succcessivo risulta precompilato."
